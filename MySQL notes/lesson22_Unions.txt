I. union
   combine the results of two or more select statements
II. syntax
   select statement union select statement1...;
   ps.   the number of columns between tables must be SAME
      ex.   I've two tables: income and expenses:
         income:
            id|item         |amount
            1 |wage         |12000.00
            2 |scholarship  |5000.00
            3 |bonus        |89.64
         expenses:
            id|item         |amount
            1 |dayly payment|3000.00
            2 |rent         |1200.00
            3 |tax          |120.35
         select * from income union select * from expense;
            result:
            id|item         |amount
            1 |wage         |12000.00
            2 |scholarship  |5000.00
            3 |bonus        |89.64
            1 |dayly payment|3000.00
            2 |rent         |1200.00
            3 |tax          |120.35
      ps. you can calculate blance:
         SELECT (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM income) - (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM expenses) AS blance;
III. diference between union and union all
   i. UNION
      just print the same value once
   ii. UNION ALL
      print all the same value
