I. on delete
   i. ON DELETE SET NULL
      when a foreign key is deleted, replace foreign key with NULL
   ii. ON DELETE CASCADE
      when a foreign key is deleted, delete row
II. others
   i. SET foreign_key_checks = 0;
      MySQL will never check foreign key
      useful to delete a row with a foreign key
III. syntax
   i. create a foreign key
      ALTER TABLE tableName
      ADD CONSTRAINT foreignKeyName
      FOREIGN KEY(columnName) REFERENCES otherTableName(columnName)
      ON DELETE ...;
      ps.   THE FOREIGN KEY COLUMN IN THE REFERENCED TABLE MUST BE INDEXED
         ex.   ALTER TABLE counter
               ADD INDEX indexProductID(productID);
      ex.   I've two tables named customers and counter;
         customers:
            id|firstName|lastName|productID|productName        |price
            1 |Caesar   |LEE     |1        |steak              |5.99
            2 |Caesar   |LEE     |2        |apple              |1.99
            3 |Caesar   |LEE     |3        |peanut             |3.99
            4 |Caesar   |LEE     |4        |pineapple          |3.99
            5 |Caesar   |LEE     |5        |coconut            |5.99
            6 |Caesar   |LEE     |6        |chocolate          |9.99
            7 |Caesar   |LEE     |7        |chocolate ice crame|19.99
            8 |Alex     |Chang   |1        |steak              |5.99
            9 |Alex     |Chang   |6        |chocolate          |5.99
         counter:
           id|salespersonID|productID
           1|8964          |1
           2|8964          |2
           3|8964          |3
           4|8964          |4
           5|8964          |5
           6|8964          |6
           7|8964          |7
           8|8964          |1
           9|8964          |6
         ALTER TABLE customers
         ADD CONSTRAINT foreignKEYCustomers
         FOREIGN KEY(productID) REFERENCES counter(productID)
         ON DELETE (SET NULL)|(CASCADE);
         ps.   you need to add a new index of productID for the table what you want to reference
               for this, it's counter
         then when I delete some rows, like:
            DELETE FROM counter
            WHERE productID = 1;
         (1, 8964, 1) and (8, 8964, 1) rows of counter
         and (1, "Caesar", "LEE", 1, "steak", 5.99) and (8, "Alex", "Chang", 1, "steak", 5.99)
         were changed
         deleted or productID was setted to NULL
