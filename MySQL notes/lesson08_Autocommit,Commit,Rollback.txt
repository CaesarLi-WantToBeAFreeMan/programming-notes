1. transaction:
      is a sequential (連續) group of statements, queries (查詢) or operations
      in other words, it likes a collection of some statements
2. autocommit:
      by default autocommit is set to on
      every executed statement was saved automatically
      in other words, MySQL will set every statement as a transaction
3. set autocommit to off:
      SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0;
4. commit:
      set all statements from last commit to this as a transaction
5. rollback:
      it'll back to last transaction state
      in other words, it likes undo but not just last one statement
