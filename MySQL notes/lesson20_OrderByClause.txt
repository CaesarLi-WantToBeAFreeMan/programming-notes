I. default
   is sorted by ID in ascending order
II. ordered by a column based on string in alphabetical order
   eg.   name
      ex. SELECT * FROM friends ORDER BY firstName;
III. descending order      DESC
   SELECT * FROM friends ORDER BY columnName DESC;    //from the last one to the first one
                                                      //eg. from z to a for string
                                                      //    from the latest to earliest date or time
                                                      //    from the biggest to the smallest number
IV. ascending order        ASC;                       //default
   SELECT * FROM friends ORDER BY columnName ASC;     //from the first one to the last one
V. multiple order rules
   SELECT * FROM friends ORDER BY firstName, lastName, age;
   ordered by firstName first, then by lastName when they're the same, and finally by age
      and you can type asc || desc at the end as well
         ex. SELECT * FROM friends ORDER BY firstName ASC, lastName ASC, age DESC;
