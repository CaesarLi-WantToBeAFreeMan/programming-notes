1. primary key:
   can be applied to a column where each value in that column must both be unique and not null
   in other words:   primary key = unique constraint + not null constraint
   and you can only add a SINGLE primary key in a table
2. syntax:
   i. create:
      CREATE TABLE tableName(columnName variable primary key...);
   ii. add constraint:
      ALTER TABLE tableName ADD CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY(columnName);
