I. self join
   join another copy of a table to itself
   used to compare rows of the same table
   help to display a hierarchy (層次結構) of data
II. syntax
   SELECT *
      FROM products AS alias
      INNER JOIN tableName AS alias1
      ON alias.columnName = alias.columnName1
   in other words, you need to give a table two aliases to use it
   ex.   I've a table named products:
            id|name    |referenceID
            1 |Hotdog  |NULL
            2 |Burger  |NULL
            3 |Barbeque|NULL
            4 |Coffee  |2
            5 |Soda    |1
         SELECT *
            FROM products AS drinks
            INNER JOIN products AS food
            ON drinks.referenceID = food.id;
            result:
               id|name  |referenceID|id|name  |referenceID
               3 |Coffee|2          |2 |Burger|NULL
               4 |Soda  |1          |1 |Hotdog|NULL
         or just print some parts of it
         SELECT drinks.id, drinks.name AS "drink name", food.name AS "food name"
            FROM products AS drinks
            INNER JOIN products AS food
            ON drinks.referenceID = food.id;
            result:
               id|drink name|food name
               3 |Coffee    |Burger
               4 |Soda      |Hotdog
