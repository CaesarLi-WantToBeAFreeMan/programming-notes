I. stored procedure (程式)
   is prepared SQL code that you can save
   great if there's a query that you write often
   like define a function that you call often
II. syntax
   i. definition
      DELIMITER charcter                              //tell MySQL which character means end
      CREATE PROCEDURE procedureName()                                     //void
      CREATE PROCEDURE procedureName(IN parameterName parameterType...)    //having at least one parameter
      BEGIN
         write code here
      END character
      exI.  select all unique customer names who were served by a salesperson
         DELIMITER @                      //tell the MySQL which character means end
         CREATE PROCEDURE getSalespersonIDNCustomerName()
         BEGIN
         SELECT DISTINCT   counter.salespersonID AS "salesperson ID",
                           CONCAT(customers.firstName, " ", customers.lastName) AS customer
         FROM counter
         INNER JOIN customers ON counter.productID = customers.productID
         ORDER BY CONCAT(customers.firstName, " ", customers.lastName);
         END@
         DELIMITER ;                      //tell the MySQL rollback to default, semicolon (;)
      exII. select all columns that with id = customerID
         DELIMITER @
         CREATE PROCEDURE getAllCounterColumnsWhen(IN customerID INT)
         BEGIN
            SELECT *
            FROM counter
            WHERE id = customerID;
         END@
         DELIMITER ;
      exIII. select all rows with firstName = fN AND lastName = lN
         DELIMITER @
         CREATE PROCEDURE getAllCustomerRowsWhen(IN fN VARCHAR(30), IN lN VARCHAR(30))
         BEGIN
            SELECT *
            FROM customers
            WHERE firstName = fN AND lastName = lN;
         END@
         DELIMITER ;
   ii. invocation
      CALL procedureName(argument)
   iii. deletion
      DROP PROCEDURE procedureName;
