1. foreign key:
   using a foreign key we can establish a link between two tables
   foreign key constraint is defined on the child table
   you cann't     I. update or delete a parent row that is used as a foreign key by other table
                  II. insert a foreign key what parent table doesn't exist
   ex.   I have two tables: users and orders.
         a user can have one or more orders,
         and a user can don't have one order(null)
         but an order can't be done by more than one users
            SQL:
               ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY(oneOrderID) REFERENCES orders(orderID);
2. syntax:
   i. create a table
      CREATE TABLE chlidTableName(FOREIGN KEY(chlidTableColumnName) REFERENCES parentTableName(parentTableColumnName));
   ii. create a foreign key
      ALTER TABLE chlidTableName ADD CONSTRAINT {foreignKeyName} FOREIGN KEY(chlidTableColumnName) REFERENCES parentTableName(parentTableColumnName)
      {not necessary type}      
   iii. delete
      ALTER TABLE tableName DROP FOREIGN KEY foreignKeyName;
